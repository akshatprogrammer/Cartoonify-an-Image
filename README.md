# Steps to develop Image Cartoonifier

## Step1: Importing the required modules
<b> Importing the required modules: </b></br>
1. CV2: Imported to use OpenCV for image processing.</br>
2. easygui: Imported to open a file box. It allows us to select any file from our system.</br>
3. Numpy: Images are stored and processed as numbers. These are taken as arrays. We use NumPy to deal with arrays.</br>
4. Imageio: Used to read the file which is chosen by file box using a path.</br>
5. Matplotlib: This library is used for visualization and plotting. Thus, it is imported to form the plot of images.</br>
6. OS: For OS interaction. Here, to read the path and save images to that path.</br>

## Step 2: Building a File Box to choose a particular file
In this step, we will build the main window of our application, where the buttons, labels, and images will reside. We also give it a title by title() function.</br>
